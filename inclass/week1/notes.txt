Project Euler Problem 3
Largest Prime Fac

So prime factors go up until the square root of the number, then it just repeats
So you only need to go up until the square root

36

1 36
2 18
3 12
4 9
6 6

maxFactor   n   i   [2, 2, 3, 3]
6           36  2
4           18  2
3           9   3
1           3

maxFactor is the square root of n rounded down (floor)

The issue is we dont know what values are prime
but it's fast enoughb to just use odd numbers for i
Continue when i <= the maxFactor
